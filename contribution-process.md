#The Contribution Process

This document describes the process by which Technical Machine prefers to handle code contributions. It's designed to be very similar to other popular open-source projects.

## Contributor's License Agreement

There isn't one. Yay!

## Step 1: Admit you have a problem

Create a Github issue on the appropriate repository if one hasn't been created already. If you're not sure which repository to assign it to, read our [System Overview](./system-overview.md) or shoot us an email (team@technical.io).

## Step 2: Claim the task

Comment on that issue to say that you're working on solving the problem so that we can avoid work duplication.

## Step 3: Branch It

Create a branch of the repo that you're working on:

```
firmware >> git checkout -b add-teleportation-api
```

## Step 3.5: Write up a Request For Comments (RFC)
Does your addition introduce a new API? Write up an API for the fix (along with any implementation details you find necessary) and post it to the forums with the RFC flag. See https://forums.tessel.io/t/wifi-api-from-js-for-the-cc3000/399 as a reference

## Step 4: Fix it up

Fix the bug or add the feature. If you have any questions, feel free to comment on the Github issue and we'll get back to you as quickly as possible.

## Step 4.5: Test your Fix

If you're adding a contribution as suggested from our [Task List](./task-list.md), we will provide a test case file that you'll need to test your addition. You'll know when you've finished the task when all the tests pass.

## Step 5: Rebase your fix

When you're ready to submit the contribution, [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) on the master branch of that repository so that merging is as smooth as possible. 

## Step 6: Submit a PR

Open a Pull Request on your branch which includes your fix as well as the passing test file. We'll either give you feedback on a few needed tweaks or accept your PR as is and run it through Rampart, our testing infrastructure.

If you are a member of the [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/tessel/teams/contributors) team, you should not run Rampart on your own PR - the person that reviews and approves your code should do it.

## Step 6: Run Rampart

Rampart is the testing framework used within Technical Machine to test every new piece of code on actual hardware. We have four Tessels with every module plugged in connected up to computer in the Technical Machine office. Before any code is merged into master, it is run through the test suite of firmware and runtime as well as every module's test suite.

Only members within the [contributors](https://github.com/orgs/tessel/teams/contributors) team have access to approve a PR to run on Rampart. If you are not on the team yet, please ask a relevant team member to run the test. Once a contributor has merged in several significant PRs and someone on the contributor's team feels they have a reasonable amount of knowledge about the system architecture and the project workflow, they may be added to the contributor's team. 

To use Rampart:
* go to [Rampart's website](https://rampart.tessel.io/merge/tessel)
* click the name of the repository that owns the relevant pull request
* click the "r+" button next to the pull request that's ready to be tested and merged. Rampart will run the change through all of the test suites and automatically merge it into master if successful. If it's not successful, it will post a link to the test results on the pull request on Github.
